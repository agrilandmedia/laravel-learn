        Looking back, 2021 will be described as an ‘up and down year’ for grass growth, but on most farms, 
        a good year for milk production. It is now mid-November, although that is hard to believe due to the relatively 
        mild weather currently being experienced. Ground conditions are now soft under foot, with most farming heavier-land
        now having animals housed for the winter months. That being said, many on drier farms, are continuing to get cows 
        out to grass. But it is important to know when to stop and house cows for the winter months.
