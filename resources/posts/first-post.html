    <h3>Tractor Stolen and Damaged in Co. Laois</h3>
    <p>
        A tractor was stolen from a farmyard in Co. Laois this week and was then found with a damaged steering
        column and the interior of the cab covered in diesel.
        It comes amid what is described as “a few incidents” of similar occurrences of vehicle theft and damage 
        near Mountrath, Co. Laois. Farmer Jimmy Dunne told Agriland that he noticed his tractor was missing from 
        his yard in Trumera, a short distance from Mountrath, yesterday morning (Tuesday, November 16) at around 
        8:30a.m.
